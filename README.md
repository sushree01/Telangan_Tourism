This project is my entry for the fifth round of the Resume Project Challenge organised by CodeBasics. The theme of the challnge revolves around providing insights to Telangana Government Tourism Department.

Challenge: Telangana is one of India’s leading states and has published its tourism data under its open data policy.
As a data analyst, Peter Pandey saw this as an opportunity to expand his skills and show his work on a bigger scale. Peter Pandey’s idea is to find the patterns in the given data, do additional research, and give data-informed recommendations to the Telangana government which can be used to increase their revenue by improving administrative operations. So, we have to analyse the scenario by putting us in the shoes of Peter Pandey.

Tools: MySQL, Microsoft PowerBI,MS Excel

Insights:
Higher revenue is generated from Domestic Tourists as compared to Foreign Tourists
There has been a positive growth in the number of foreign visitors across the timeline, but for domestic visitors, it is a negative trend except for 2018 where there was 8.93% growth as compared to previous year.
The total revenue generated on weekdays and weekend was 329 bn and 104 bn. This denotes that people like travelling to tourist places on weekends(Sat-Sun).
Hyderabad has the highest no. of visitors and Kamareddy has the lowest.
Jan-Mar and June-July has seen a peek in total number of visitors as compared to other months of the year. The trend remains the same for the domestic visitors but foreign visitors like visiting these places towards the end of the year(Oct-Jan)

Suggestion: 
We can plan for more tourist attracting events like star performance shows, musical nights,beach festivals,etc during off seasons. For the peak seasons, we can look for more stay packages,coupons, vouchers, campings,etc. This will help us generate more revenue.

I'd take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to Hemanand Vadivel, Dhaval Patel, and Bhavin Patel sir for providing us with such a great chance to learn and showcase our abilities through these projects. Thank you Mr.Kalvakuntla Taraka Rama Rao, honourable IT Minister of Telangana for his great vision to make the real data available for free.
